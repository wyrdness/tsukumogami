      "full": "Tsukumogami are a class of Japanese yokai where household items and tools gain sentience after reaching 100 years of age. The concept stems from Shinto animism (belief that all objects possess spiritual essence) combined with Buddhist teachings. These animated objects can range from benign pranksters to vengeful spirits, particularly if they were mistreated or carelessly discarded. Common examples include Karakasa (umbrella yokai), Bakezori (sandal spirits), and Kameosa (sake jar spirits). The tradition encourages respect for possessions, gratitude, and environmental consciousness, values still celebrated in modern Japanese culture through practices like Hari Kuyo (needle memorial service)."

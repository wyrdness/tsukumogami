## Overview

Tsukumogami (付喪神) are a class of Japanese yokai where household items and tools gain sentience after reaching 100 years of age. The concept stems from Shinto animism—the belief that all objects possess spiritual essence—combined with Buddhist teachings about impermanence and attachment.

These animated objects can range from benign pranksters to vengeful spirits, particularly if they were mistreated or carelessly discarded. Common examples include **Karakasa** (umbrella yokai with one eye and one leg), **Bakezori** (animated sandals), and **Kameosa** (sake jar spirits).

The tradition encourages respect for possessions, gratitude for faithful service, and environmental consciousness—values still celebrated in modern Japanese culture through practices like **Hari Kuyo** (needle memorial service).

## Cultural Origins

### Shinto Animism
In Shinto belief, all things possess **kami** (spiritual essence), including inanimate objects. This foundational animistic worldview enables objects to develop souls.

### Buddhist Influence
Buddhist concepts contribute:
- **Impermanence**: All things change and age
- **Attachment**: Objects can develop attachment to their purpose and owners
- **Respect for all beings**: Extends to objects that have served faithfully

### Mottainai (もったいない)
Core Japanese concept expressing regret over waste. Tsukumogami embody this value—carelessly discarding objects that served faithfully is both wasteful and disrespectful.
